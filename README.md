# Radius

## TODO
- "Radius" in top bar that leads to feed if logged in else identities
- What would a "discover" page look like? Would it even differ from feed?
- Allow viewing profiles offline
- Fix radius slider
- Support minRadius and maxRadius
- Use a scoring system for recommended (based on # of followers that you follow?)
- Cache last known CID of profiles you're interested in in case they dont log back in to publish via IPNS
- Fix first visit of profile from top bar having null/undefined id
- Browse while you wait for your post to send
- Verify ids on fetch, or just stop storing id inside profile altogether
- Fix having to refresh to see profile updates (or is this just ipfs being slow?)
- BE "distance between users" function
- Show hashicon + id when hovering over profile picture
- Generate key from mnemonic
  - Generate keys from Python
- Offline caching of posts/profiles
  - Especially if all of your nodes are offline for an extended time -- you will need to reupload all of your data
- Private posts (encrypted)
  - Explore splitting out post content and keys into separate CIDs
- Validation of profile/post data that result in warnings in the FE that allow the user to unfollow the "offender"
- Calculate "reach" based on number of people in your radius following you
- Explore if caching is needed
- Sort posts in feed reverse-chronologically
- How to handle likes/reactions? Are they stored in the reactor's profile?
- Show profile image, name, etc. on posts
- Show "1st" "2nd" or "3rd+" linkedin-style connection
- Replies
- Split following into its own page/tab on profile
- Make "known followers" page on profiles?
- Import/Export tool in UI
- Explore how to not store all posts within profile
  - Split by day?
- Group chats
  - Just a different interface for private posts?
- Servers/channels? Or would this be an entirely different service that uses the same identity system as Radius?
- Explore other apps you could use with the same identity system (file storage/transfer interface?)
